# Cutting stock problem

![Lumber mill](lumber_mill.png "Generated by ChatGPT")

As operator of a lumber mill, you are tasked with cutting raw materials into smaller pieces along one axis, producing smaller pieces according to client orders. Each raw is 10 meters long, making it big enough to produce more than one of the required smaller final pieces (of sizes 140, 310, 360 and 450 centimeters). The raw can be cut up into these pieces in different ways, called _patterns_. For example, you could cut the raw of 10 meters into:

- one piece each of 140, 360 and 450 centimeters, leaving 50 centimeters of waste;
- two pieces of 320 centimeters, and one of 360 centimeters, leaving no waste;
- seven pieces of 140 centimeters, leaving 20 centimeters of waste, or;
- two pieces of 450 centimeters, leaving 100 centimeters of waste.

Each possible pattern is generated through the given method `patterns`.

On a particularly busy day, you are given the following order to fulfill (as seen in [input.csv](input.csv)):

| Raw lengths  | 1000   |
|--------------|--------|

| Final length | Demand |
|--------------|--------|
| 140          | 211    |
| 310          | 395    |
| 360          | 610    |
| 450          | 97     |

## Exercises

> Let $x_k$ represent the number of raws that are cut according to pattern $k$. We should at least produce the number of finals as specified in the client order. How do the constraints look, as a function of $x_k$? Are there any other constraints?

 1. Minimize the number of raws that are required to be able to fulfill the order. How should those raws be cut? Write an [ILP program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming) using [`scipy.optimize.linprog`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html).

> As it turns out, quite some waste is generated when minimizing the number of used raws. Hence, rather than minimizing the number of used raws, let's instead minimize the produced waste. How do we express the total waste as a function of $x_k$?

 2. Adapt your program to minimize the produced waste while still fulfilling the order. How should the raws be cut?

> While minimizing waste, we favoured overproducing finals over creating waste: we often chose to produce according to patterns with zero waste - so we reduced waste, but at the cost of using more raws in order to overproduce. In reality, however, overproduced finals are also undesirable (though not as undesirable as waste), since they need to be stored until a new order comes in where they can be used.

 3. Let's consider overproduced finals to be as bad as half their length in waste, e.g. a single overproduced final of length 14 is as bad as a waste of 7. Alter your previous program to account for this.
