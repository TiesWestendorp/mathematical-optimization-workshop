# Battery charging problem

![Charging battery](charging_battery.png "Generated by ChatGPT")

In a smart grid, appliances decide their own activation time. Washing machines, dishwashers, electric vehicles, batteries, heating, ventilation and air conditioning may all delay action until better conditions arise. Depending on the stakeholder, this may be when electricity prices are lower, or to consume when energy is abundant or to deliver energy when it is scarce (irrespective of price) to flatten the energy curve.

Consider a 71.4 kWh capacity battery (the average electric vehicle battery), that can charge or discharge at a C-rating of 0.2C. This means it takes 5 hours to fully (dis)charge the battery (or 7.14 kWh within an hour). Every hour we can decide to charge or discharge somewhere within these allowed bounds, let $x_t$ be the charging decision for time $t$, and assume 100% round-trip efficiency (no energy losses), such that the state of charge $C_t$ at time $t$ can be found by simply summing the charging decisions up to time $t$ with the initial state of charge $C_0$:

$$C_t = C_0 + \sum_{k=1}^tx_k$$

Energy prices are always in flux. Attached are a several files with 1 hour window kWh-prices in euros for different dates:

- [prices-2025-4-18.csv](prices-2025-4-18.csv) contains the prices for 2025-04-18 for a 71.4 kWh capacity battery, starting at 15 kWh state of charge.
- [prices-2025-4-20.csv](prices-2025-4-20.csv) contains the prices for 2025-04-20 for a 71.4 kWh capacity battery, starting at 50 kWh state of charge.
- [prices-2025-4-21.csv](prices-2025-4-21.csv) contains the prices for 2025-04-21 for a 71.4 kWh capacity battery, starting at 15 kWh state of charge.

## Exercises

We can never "overdischarge" or "overcharge" the battery - the state of charge at every moment in time must be between zero and the capacity of the battery. Also, we can at most discharge and charge a certain amount in each time interval.

$$\begin{matrix}
0 \leq C_0 + x_1 \leq C_\text{max}\hspace{1em} \\
0 \leq C_0 + x_1 + x_2 \leq C_\text{max}\hspace{1em} \\
0 \leq C_0 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \leq C_\text{max}\hspace{1em} \\
\vdots \\\\
x_\text{min} \leq x_1 \leq x_\text{max}\\
x_\text{min} \leq x_2 \leq x_\text{max}\\
x_\text{min} \leq x_3 \leq x_\text{max}\\
\vdots\\
\end{matrix}$$

Assume that the hourly kWh prices $c_t$ are known, and that we can consume energy at that price, but also discharge energy to yield payment for the current price. (Note that $c_t$ can be negative! In those cases, it's actually profitable to charge the battery.)

1. How can we utilize our battery in order to make the most profit? Write an [ILP program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming) using [`scipy.optimize.linprog`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html).

The battery is fully depleted at the end of the day. This is fine for trading, but not if we also plan to use the car at some point. If we decide to use the car battery for energy trading, it makes sense to expect the state of charge to be more or less stable, in the sense that the state of charge at the end of the day equals to the initial state of charge.

2. Adapt your program such that the battery holds _at least_ the initial state of charge at the end of the day, such that the battery is more or less "stable".

What if we make up our mind and want to use our car at some point during the day? It makes sense to impose additional constraints on how full it should be.

3. Instead of only being stable, we the state of charge to be at least 50% for all time periods after 50% of time has elapsed. Adapt your program.

**Bonus question:** In practice, we're not able to trade back at the current spot price, but get a fixed (low) subsidy per kWh $s$ for providing energy if our net energy profile (the sum of our other energy usage along with the battery $x_t + p_t$) is negative, and pay $c_t$ per kWh otherwise.
 
This means that we don't minimize $\sum_{t=1}^T c_tx_t$, but rather: $\sum_{t=1}^T \left(c_t(x_t+p_t)^+ + s(x_t+p_t)^-\right)$. It's not straightforward, but there is a way to formulate this as a linear optimization problem.
