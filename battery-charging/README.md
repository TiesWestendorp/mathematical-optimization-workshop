# Battery charging problem

![Charging battery](charging_battery.png "Generated by ChatGPT")

In a smart grid, appliances decide their own activation time. Washing machines, dishwashers, electric vehicles, batteries, heating, ventilation and air conditioning may all delay action until better conditions arise. Depending on the stakeholder, this may be when electricity prices are lower, or to consume when energy is abundant or to deliver energy when it is scarce (irrespective of price) to flatten the energy curve.

Consider a 71.4 kWh capacity battery (the average electric vehicle battery), that can charge or discharge at a C-rating of 0.2C. This means it takes 5 hours to fully (dis)charge the battery (or 7.14 kWh within an hour). Every hour we can decide to charge or discharge somewhere within these allowed bounds, let $x_t$ be the charging decision for time $t$, and assume 100% round-trip efficiency (no energy losses), such that the state of charge $C_t$ at time $t$ can be found by simply summing the charging decisions up to time $t$ with the initial state of charge $C_0$:

$$C_t = C_0 + \sum_{k=1}^tx_k$$

1. How can we utilize our battery in order to make the most profit? Write an [ILP program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming) using [`scipy.optimize.linprog`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html) that minimizes the linear price objective: $\sum_{t=1}^T c_t x_t$ where $c_t$ are the energy costs at time $t$ (they may be negative!), and $x_t$ is the battery (dis)charge decision on time $t$.

- [prices-2025-4-18.csv](prices-2025-4-18.csv) contains the 1 hour window kWh-prices in euros for 2025-04-18 for a 71.4 kWh capacity battery, starting at 15 kWh state of charge.
- [prices-2025-4-20.csv](prices-2025-4-20.csv) contains the 1 hour window kWh-prices in euros for 2025-04-20 for a 71.4 kWh capacity battery, starting at 50 kWh state of charge.
- [prices-2025-4-21.csv](prices-2025-4-21.csv) contains the 1 hour window kWh-prices in euros for 2025-04-21 for a 71.4 kWh capacity battery, starting at 15 kWh state of charge.

$$0 \leq C_0 + \sum_{k=1}^t x_k \leq C_\text{max}\hspace{1em}\forall t=1,\ldots,T\hspace{1.5em}(*)\\
x_\text{min} \leq x_t \leq x_\text{max} \hspace{4em}\forall t=1,\ldots,T\hspace{1em}(**)$$

2. Battery must be at least the initial charge at the end of the day

3. Charge must always be at least 50% after 50% of time has elapsed

[profile.csv](profile.csv) contains the expected 1 hour window net energy consumption/production-profile for a full day. How can we utilize our battery in order to flatten the curve as much as possible? Write a least squares optimization problem using TODO. Minimize the sum of squares objective: $\sum_k {(x_k - p_k)^2}$, where $x_k$ is the battery (dis)charge decision on time $k$, and $p_k$ is the expected net profile without the battery.
3. What do you suspect happens if multiple devices are present in the network under each of these objectives?
